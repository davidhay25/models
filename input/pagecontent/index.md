# CanShare Logical Models

An implementation guide for the logical models produced by the [CanShare Logical Modeller](http://poc.canshare.co.nz/models.html).

Only logical models are included - there will be separate IGs for the FHIR profiles and extension definintions as well. Format is yet to be decided,

Here is [a list](toc.html) of all the models (DataGroups) currently defined. Better index pages to follow.
