# CanShare Logical Models

An implementation guide for the logical models produced by the [CanShare Logical Modeller](http://poc.canshare.co.nz/models.html).

The guide contains both Logical Models and Profiles.

* Logical models represent the information needed for some purpose using FHIR datatypes, but not FHIR resources. They are produced during the analysis amnd design
part of the process.
* Profiles represent the information from the Logical Models expressed as FHIR resources and the relationships between them

The following tabs are present in the guide.

* [LIM structure](structure.html) describes the overall structure of the Ligical Information Modeller (LIM) that us used to create the artifacts
* [Compositions models](compLMIndex.html) is a list of the composition Logical models
* [Composition profiles](compositionProfileIndex.html) are the FHIR profiles created from the Logical models. Note that these are very much a work in progress
* [DataGroup models](dgLMIndex.html) lists the logical models created from the DataGroups
* [DataGroup profiles](dgProfileIndex.html) are the profiles generation from the DataGroup Logical models
* [Extensions](extensionIndex.html) lists the extensions created to support profiling of the DataGroup Logical models
* [Artifacts](artifacts.html) is a list generated during the IG publishing process and has a complete list of all artifacts in the IG
